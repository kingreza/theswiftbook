# Structures

Structures and Classes make up the building blocks of your code. We are going to start with Structures, their syntax and general purpose. Then we will highlight how they are like Classes and then we will at look what makes them different

Structures, much like Classes can hold your variables and functions. In Swift, defining a new Structure is simple. 

## [Syntax](#syntax)
````Swift
struct Person {
  
}
````
As mentioned earlier, Structures, much like classes can have properties that will store values,

````Swift
struct Person {
  var name: String = "John Doe"
}
````

TODO: just give a few examples of how a structure can be created and even create them from different protocols perhpas and then link to protocols

## [Versus Classes](#versus-classes)

TODO: talk about how structures are different from classes and give examples
