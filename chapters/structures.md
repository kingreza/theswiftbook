# Structures

TODO: talk about what structures are and talk about what other languages have something similar. I think OCaml has something similar. Also tell the reader why you would want to use structures over classes

Structures and Classes make up the building blocks of your code. We are going to start with Structures, their syntax and general purpose. Then we will highlight how they are similar to Classes and finally we look what makes them different

Structures, much like Classes can hold your variables and functions. In Swift, defining a new Structure is simple. 

## [Syntax](#syntax)

TODO: just give a few examples of how a structure can be created and even create them from different protocols perhpas and then link to protocols

## [Versus Classes](#versus-classes)

TODO: talk about how structures are different from classes and give examples
