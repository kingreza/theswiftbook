# Conditionals

TODO: write about why we need conditionals and how they are useful in real life. Give an example in Swift where a problem cannot be solved without a conditional

## [If Statement](#if-statement)

TODO: talk about `if` and `else` and give as many examples as possible

## [Ternary Operator](#ternary-operator)

TODO: talk about the ternary `x = condition ? value1 : value2` operator here and give examples. Best to let the reader know that complicated ternaries can make the code quite difficult to understand and read
