# Passing Functions as Arguments

TODO: tell the reader why it migth be useful to pass functions to functions, as arguments. give a few examples. perhaps a completion handler of a structure that can download a URL would be useful since the completion handler is going to be a function

## [Guidelines](#guidelines)

TODO: if you have an Int to pass to a function and a function as the second argument, it's best to not pass the function as the first argument to take advantage of the function shorthands in swift where the whole function's argument name can be skipped. talk about that here
