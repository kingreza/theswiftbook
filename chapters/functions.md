# Functions

TODO: talk about reusability of code and why it is important not to repeat a piece of code

## [Syntax](#syntax)

TODO: given a few examples of functions and explain their syntax, with and without arguments or return values and then link the user to other sections under the Functions super section, such as [Arguments](function_arguments.md), [Return Type](function_return_type.md), etc

## [Versus Properties](#versus-properties)

TODO: explain where a function is more useful than a property. it usually comes down to the fact that a property is a function without arguments but perhaps there are other cases (such as functional programming) where functions are more useful
