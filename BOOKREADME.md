#The Swift Book

Welcome to The Swift Book: The first open-source Swift book, viewed and editable by everyone!

## Who is this book for?

This book is for those who want to learn how to write programs in Apple's programming language; Swift!

The goal of this book is to write the most up to date content for Swift, with peer-reviewed content and examples to ensure accuracy. You need a certain level of understanding of how a computer works, such as:

* How different parts of a computer work together.
* What computer-memory is and how it works.
* What the names of different parts of your computer are, such as the "monitor"!

We will be referring to terms such as RAM, or memory. Should a term be unclear, we will provide a definition of it. We will provide a link where you can read more about that term if the definition is not provided in the book itself.

## Which operating system must I have?

Swift is available for both Mac OS X and Linux. The majority of this book's content will focus on Swift as a pure programming language, with no links to any Mac OS X specific packages or software. You should therefore be confident that what you learn in The Swift Book will be applicable in all platforms on which Swift is supported.

For a list of available Swift releases, [visit this page](https://swift.org/download/#releases).

## How can I install Swift?

* On OS X, simply download Xcode (free) from the App Store. Xcode comes with Swift already built-in.
* On Linux, simply navigate to [this page](https://swift.org/download/#releases) to download and install Swift.

Swift is currently not supported on Windows.[^1]
